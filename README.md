# NotepadWeb
Very basic web text editor. While GitHub likes to think that it's all HTML because it's literally a single file, it's made in CSS and JavaScript too.
# Usage
Option 1: Open it using the link provided in the sidebar<br/>
Option 2: Download from source
- Download source
- Open Notepad Web.html
- Web browser opens tab with it
# Environment/Host
Basically all you need is a text editor and a browser. You don't need a webserver, double-clicking the HTML file opens it perfectly in most browsers.
# Third-party code
I use some third party code because, to be honest with you, I don't know what I'm doing.
